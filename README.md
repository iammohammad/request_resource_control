# Deep SARA: Enhancing Network Slicing in 5G Core Through Advanced Admission Control and Resource Allocation

In the realm of cutting-edge telecommunications, the concept of Network Slicing stands as a pivotal advancement, offering tailored virtualized networks to cater to the specific requirements of diverse industrial verticals. In the context of 5G networks, which hold the promise of revolutionary applications such as Enhanced Mobile Broadband, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, and the proliferation of the Internet of Things, ensuring optimal Quality of Service (QoS) for each distinct use case becomes paramount. This necessitates the formulation of refined strategies pertaining to both Admission Control and Resource Allocation within the framework of network slicing in 5G core networks.

The intricacies of the Admission Control mechanism are addressed through the introduction of two innovative solutions, each with the goal of refining the admission policy to maximize the operational profit for Network Slice Providers. The first solution, aptly named SARA, leverages Reinforcement Learning techniques to iteratively learn and optimize the admission policy. Building upon this foundation, the second solution, known as DSARA, harnesses the power of Deep Reinforcement Learning to further elevate the learning process and decision-making capabilities. Both SARA and DSARA are intricately designed to accommodate the diverse 5G use cases outlined by the esteemed 3rd Generation Partnership Project.

Complementing the Admission Control mechanism is the Resource Allocation strategy, a pivotal component aimed at harmonizing the load distribution across network nodes while simultaneously minimizing the utilization of precious network resources. This strategic endeavor is undertaken with the overarching objective of enhancing network efficiency and robustness.

In summary, the Deep SARA initiative is emblematic of a concerted effort to refine and optimize the landscape of network slicing within 5G core networks. By synergistically combining advanced Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques within the Admission Control paradigm, and concurrently implementing astute Resource Allocation mechanisms, the initiative underscores a holistic approach to address the distinctive QoS requirements of divergent 5G use cases. Through such a comprehensive and sophisticated approach, the telecommunications industry is poised to unlock the full potential of Network Slicing, thus propelling the realization of the 5G vision in its entirety.
